:mod:`What's New`
----------------------------

v0.7.0 (July 22, 2022)
======================

* `em.sel2d()` now uses `xoak` to find the nearest neighbor grid point on ND grids. Due to this change, `em.argsel2d()` doesn't exist anymore. Note that vertical functionality that was previously in `em.sel2d()` is now in `em.selZ()`.
* Provide more options in `em.filter()` for keeping different coordinates in a `Dataset`.
* Improvement to unit test setup.
* `em.preprocess()` will implicitly assign horizontal coordinates longitude and latitude for POM
  datasets, even if the data do not specify `coordinates` attributes explicitly.
* `em.sub_bbox()` supports subsetting FVCOM model output.
* A new jupyter notebook demonstrating subsetting of FVCOM model output is now available in docs.
* `em.sub_grid()` supports subsetting FVCOM model output.
